# IOBrew
IOU App for Beer!

IOBrew is a new concept, an IOU app that doesn't scrutinize over nickels and dimes but rather lets friends exchange frosty
cold ones for whatever the reason may be.

- Friend helped you move?  Grab that guy a 6 pack and with IOBrew you won't forget to reward his good deed.
- Forgot your wallet at the bar?  No problem, have  abuddy grab you one and list it in the IOBrew app so you remember to return the favor.
- Make the world a better place via friendly beer exchange!

Why does the world need IOBrew?  It's a way to ensure our good intentions don't go forgotten.  There's been times in the past
where I personally wanted to get someone a beer for helping me out, only to later forget.  If I had IOBrew it would've been as easy as 
adding the brew exchange to the web app, which will even send me an email reminder if I so choose.

I know what you're thinking now, but what if someone owes me a beer and I want to remmeber that?  Well IOBrew lets that
become a reality as well!  You can also keep track of all beers owed to you via a seperate page.  Have your friends sign up
and ensure they receive your beer related requests or simply use the app to keep track on your own without sending
requests all around.

### But wait, there's more!

IOBrew allows for achievement tracking!  Always the guy spotting your friends?  Might as well get some nice achievement medals for it
to receive never-ending internet fame!  IOBrew tracks your usage and will reward you with a large variety of achievements
to show off on your profile page.
